# Obj-Renderer
Very basic, standalone .Obj renderer.

# Backstory
I wrote this program around 2 years ago during summer break, from start to finish it took about 2 weeks to research, develop, and eventually complete.

# Specifications
The program is essentially standalone using very few, rudimentary, libraries. These libraries include:

(strstream, algorithm, windows.h, iostream, cassert, fstream, sstream, vector, list)

All held within one file, the program is just under 1700 lines
